# object-decetion

Protecting ourself from obstacles during night or in foggy and in pollution in front of cars and all other vehicles, since they cause reduced visibility, the chances of occurring an accidents is much higher and it also help us in saving animals which are getting hit by vehicles during night.

* The main motive of our project is to reduce the likelihood of much higher occurrence of accident, majority due to fog and pollution.
* To prevent accidents and saving animals from killing by hitting vehicles during night and foggy days since they cause reduced visibility.

#Advantages

*The main perk that you can get from using a radar detector is for creating awareness.
*The function is to warm or alert when there is obstacle ahead of your vehicle.
*They Improve safety radar increases your safety when obstacle is Infront of the vehicle it defects priority and gives information.

We have tested several times so that we can overcome our problems and improve our solution to develop our prototype. We have got error while running the processing code first we have no idea about that app so it took time to understand and run the code.
We have also found errors in uploading the code to the Arduino that it is showing compile error. we didn't include the library files to code.so, we installed the library file named <servo.h> in the Arduino software. Then code complied successfully and done uploading.
